## Overview

The project aims to create a website for changing black and white images to coloured ones. It is trained over an existing dataset available. The website inputs the black and white image using HTML forms and converts them to colour images using the trained data. The coloured image is displayed in the output screen.

This project is for those uncoloured yet memorable moments stored in your albums. Filling them with colous makes them more memorable. So, let's bring your old memories back to life!

## Libraries used

Numpy, OpenCV

## How it works

The website opens to provide a description of the program and a button to upload image. Clicking on the button leads to a webpage to upload the picture. Insert the black and white image from your desktop and click submit button. You will get the colorized image on your screen.

## To run program

1. Fork and clone repo to device 

2. Download necessary models, including the one mentioned above, and save them in the same folder as the source code 

3. Run recognize.py, upload image and get the colorized image
